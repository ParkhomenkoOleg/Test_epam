I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

"It is always nice to see you"
Says the man behind the counter to the woman who was coming
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hello's
